### Visual Design

My goal was to evoke the sense of cuddling up in a dark room, lit only by the light of the television. It needed to be a little sexy, but also, super chill. 
I started first with a mood board to establish this tone. Gathering bits of imagery that juxtaposed dark atmosphere with splashes vibrant neon. Overall the feeling is both dramatic and calming, like something out of a dream or movie.

### Color & Typography

Using my mood board to guide my visual choices I narrowed in on a color palette, a dark theme with a cool green, and sultry red tones. I played around with substantial, high impact typefaces and lockups for the logo.

### Element Collage

I crafted together some necessary interface elements into an element collage. This gave me a full spectrum view of what my interfaces could look like allowing me to insure my app would match my chill vibe.

### Prototype

I used <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/projects/boards/4948818">Adobe Experience</a> to create a few key screens, along with a prototype to show user flow and interaction.
