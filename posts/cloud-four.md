Over the two years I worked for Cloud Four I did really interesting work with various clients some big like Walmart, some small like local startups. Most of that work consisted of pattern libraries, design systems and design in the browser. All of the work was complete design/development overlap, and is the foundation of how I love to work to this day. I consider myself a technical designer. One who codes, _and_ makes things beautiful. I wouldn't go so far as to say it made me believe in "unicorns" (the elusive designer that can do it all), however, the time I spent at Cloud Four made me realize that you don't really have to choose one or the other. You can do both. 
I wrote a few posts, check them out on the Cloud Four website:
